# IKEv2 VPN Server on Docker

Recipe to build, clone this repo and run `docker build . -t "testing/ikev2-vpn-server"`

## Usage

#### For using iTunes Home Sharing / Plex Shareing connect directly to your LAN network

### 1. Start the IKEv2 VPN Server (the -p options are outdated for utalizing Bonjour, bridge directly to LAN)

    docker run --privileged -d --name ikev2-vpn-server --restart=always -p 500:500/udp -p 4500:4500/udp gaomd/ikev2-vpn-server:0.3.0

### 2. Generate the .mobileconfig (for iOS / macOS)

    docker run --privileged -i -t --rm --volumes-from ikev2-vpn-server -e "HOST=vpn1.example.com" gaomd/ikev2-vpn-server:0.3.0 generate-mobileconfig > ikev2-vpn.mobileconfig

*Be sure to replace `vpn1.example.com` with your own domain name and resolve it to you server's IP address. Simply put an IP address is supported as well (and enjoy an even faster handshake speed).*

Transfer the generated `ikev2-vpn.mobileconfig` file to your local computer via SSH tunnel (`scp`) or any other secure methods.

### 3. Install the .mobileconfig (for iOS / macOS)

- **iOS 9 or later**: AirDrop the `.mobileconfig` file to your iOS 9 device, finish the **Install Profile** screen;

- **macOS 10.11 El Capitan or later**: Double click the `.mobileconfig` file to start the *profile installation* wizard.
